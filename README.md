RyzomAPI
========

## DEPENDENCIES

This program requires these other modules and libraries:

	Dancer
	RyzomAPI


## COPYRIGHT AND LICENCE

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the same terms as Perl itself, either Perl version 5.18.2 or,
at your option, any later version of Perl 5 you may have available.


## HOW TO USE

Once this software's dependencies are successfully installed, this software may
be started by running the following command from the top level directory:

	$ perl bin/app.pl

This will start a lightweight web server waiting for connections on port 3000
(default port).

You can then configure your Ryzom client to connect to this application. To do
that, start the Ryzom client and hit shift+w. Click on 'ADD APP' and use
`http://127.0.0.1:3000/<guild key>` as the url (assuming you the default port is
used) where guild key is a key generated by one of your guild officers.

The first time a guild key is used, the server will build a cache. This
operation may take a while depending on network speed and it is possible the
in-game web browser will report a time out. This is a one time process, you need
to wait for the cache generation to be complete and try again. You may also
experience a long load time when the guild hall's inventory has changed a lot
between to cache update.
